          Spring is the first season in the year.
          In our country, it lasts from March to May.
          In spring, the weather is comfortable, but it changes a lot. It rains sometimes.
          Many things come into life in spring.
          The trees turn green.
          People like to go outdoors to have fun.
          Besides, farmers are busy in spring, because itâ€™s time for them to plant crops.
          All people are preparing for the whole year.
